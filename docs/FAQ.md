## FAQ
### How can the ULS process be monitored ?
ULS provides a [dedicated monitoring output](MONITORING.md) that allows to understand the performance values as well as the throughput.
This can also be used to monitor the "alive state" of ULS.

- Try to updated ULS to the latest version.
- Try to update the related "CLI-TOOLS" to the latest version

### `uls.py --version` does not show all versions
This is (sadly) a known issue. It is a problem within some of the CLI's if no ".edgerc" file is provided. If you provide a `.edgerc`, the show is correct.
