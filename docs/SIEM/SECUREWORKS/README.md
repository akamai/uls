# Secureworks

Securewroks has its very own and well documentation ULS integration page. (KUDOS for this !! - You have done great work)

So to reduce overhead, we're just linking from here to heir docs.

- [Akamai Enterprise Application Access (EAA) Integration Guide](https://docs.taegis.secureworks.com/integration/connectCloud/akamai_eaa/)
- [Akamai Guardicore Segmentation Integration Guide](https://docs.taegis.secureworks.com/integration/connectMicrosegmentation/akamai_guardicore/)
- [Akamai App and API Protector (not **yet** in ULS)](https://docs.taegis.secureworks.com/integration/connectCloud/akamai_api_protector/)

The docs are absolutely detailed and shows the flexibility of the 2 systems working perfectly together.
